## Overview
MMapper is a graphical mapping tool for the MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) game MUME (Multi-Users in Middle Earth). While MUME traditionally offers a text-only interface, MMapper enhances the experience by providing a **dynamic, interactive map** of the game world. Acting as a bridge between the MUME server and your game client, MMapper analyzes real-time game data and visually displays your character’s position on the map.

## Why Use MMapper?
- **Visualize Your World**: Tired of memorizing directions? MMapper automatically maps rooms, terrain, and exits, updating the map in real time as you explore, so you always have an accurate view of your surroundings.
- **Navigate Easily**: By highlighting terrain types (e.g., forests, roads, mountains) and exits, MMapper helps you quickly understand your environment and find the fastest path.
- **Enhanced Gameplay**: With features like terrain detection, pseudo-3D views, and group map sharing, MMapper adds an extra layer of convenience and immersion to your MUME experience.

## Key Features
- **Automated Mapping**: Rooms, terrain types, exits, and connections are automatically mapped and updated as you explore. The map updates in real-time as you move through the game world.
- **Interactive Map**: Fast OpenGL rendering provides smooth navigation, and the pseudo-3D view allows you to manage room layers with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: MMapper is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, allowing you to use it on any major platform.
- **Group Map Sharing**: See the movement of other players on your map in real-time, making it easier to track team members and collaborate.
- **Built-In MUD Client**: MMapper includes a MUD client, letting you easily interact with the game world while simultaneously managing your map.
- **Remote Editing**: Instead of using the MUD’s built-in editor, you can edit your map’s text file with your favorite text editor or MMapper’s built-in editor for a more comfortable editing experience.
