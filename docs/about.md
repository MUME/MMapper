## About MMapper

MMapper is a graphical mapping tool that enhances the MUME (Multi-Users in Middle Earth) experience by providing a **dynamic, interactive map** of the game world. Tired of memorizing directions? MMapper acts as a bridge between the MUME server and your game client, analyzing real-time game data and visually displaying your character’s position on the map. Visualize your world, navigate easily with terrain highlighting, and enjoy enhanced gameplay with features like terrain detection, pseudo-3D views, and group map sharing.
